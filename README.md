# Python-GUI_Projects
### About Repository 
This repository contains python based mini GUI project built using Tkinter and Turtle.
The graphical user interface (GUI) is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.

## Tkinter Programming
Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkitThis calculator replicates the operations of the simple calculator and additionally, it helps you to calculate the mod, factorial exponential, and square of the given value

## Turtle Programming
"Turtle" is a Python feature like a drawing board, which lets us command a turtle to draw all over it! We can use functions like turtle.forward(…) and turtle.right(…) which can move the turtle around.
